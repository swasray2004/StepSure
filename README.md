## What is StepSure?

StepSure is a cross-platform Flutter application that uses AI to analyse a patient's walking pattern through their smartphone camera, then generates a personalised rehabilitation programme. No wearables. No clinic visits required. No internet connection needed during analysis.

The app is designed specifically for **post-stroke gait rehabilitation** — a field where 95% of rural patients currently receive zero professional support between the rare clinic visits they can access.

---

## The Problem We're Solving

| Reality | Numbers |
|---|---|
| Stroke survivors who need rehabilitation | **80 million** worldwide |
| Average wait for physiotherapy appointment | **6 weeks** |
| Rural patients who never see a physiotherapist | **95%** |
| Cost per physio session (India) | **₹1,500 – 3,000** |
| Cost of StepSure per month | **₹199** |

Between clinic appointments, patients walk incorrectly for weeks — reinforcing bad movement patterns and causing long-term damage. Clinicians have zero visibility into what's happening at home. StepSure closes that gap.

## Core Features

### 🦿 Gait Analysis Engine
- **33-landmark skeletal mapping** — Google ML Kit Pose Detection processes every frame of a 30-second walk
- **7 deficit classifications** — symmetry, cadence, stride length, knee deviation, trunk lean, balance instability, hip flexion
- **Fall risk scoring** — Low / Moderate / High, calculated from stride variability coefficient of variation
- **Recovery score** — composite metric tracked session-to-session: `(Symmetry×0.40) + (Cadence×0.20) + (Consistency×0.20) + (100−JointDev)×0.20`
- **100% on-device** — analysis runs locally via the device NPU; no data leaves the phone during recording

### 🎯 AI Exercise Prescription
- **Rule-based deficit matching** — each gait deficit triggers a specific set of targeted exercises
- **18-exercise library** — from single-leg balance to metronome walking, all medically validated
- **3D Mixamo-rendered animations** — professional skeletal character animations, rendered via Blender and played as looping videos in Flutter
- **Voice guidance** — real-time audio cues using `flutter_tts` with 6-second cooldown per cue

### 📊 Progress Tracking
- **Session-over-session recovery curves** — visualised with `fl_chart`
- **Gemini-powered rehab reports** — AI-generated clinical PDF summaries shareable with physiotherapists
- **Clinician dashboard** — real-time gait metrics for enrolled patients (B2B feature)

### 🔒 Clinical Safety
- Conservative exercise defaults — system never prescribes at the edge of capability
- High fall risk → consultation alert (not more exercises)
- Camera confidence scoring — low-quality recordings prompt re-record rather than generating unreliable results

## Exercise Prescription Engine

Each gait deficit maps to targeted exercises:

| Deficit | Exercises Prescribed |
|---|---|
| Poor symmetry (< 60%) | Alternating Step Drill, Lateral Weight Shift |
| Low cadence (< 70 spm) | Metronome Walking, Fast Feet Drill |
| Short stride (< 0.9m) | Step-Length Training, Exaggerated Marching |
| Knee deviation (> 30°) | Knee Stability Squat, Terminal Knee Extension |
| Forward trunk lean (> 8°) | Posture Correction, Chest Opener |
| High fall risk | Single-Leg Balance, Tandem Tightrope Walk |
| Hip flexion deficit | Hip Flexor Lunge, Calf Raises |

## 3D Animation Pipeline

StepSure uses professional Mixamo character animations — not hand-coded skeletons. The pipeline:

Blender (render_pipeline.py)

  ├── Teal material palette applied
  ├── 30° three-quarter camera view
  └── Renders looping MP4 per exercise

post_process.py (FFmpeg)
  ├── Re-encode: H.264 baseline, +faststart, yuv420p (iOS compatible)
  ├── Resize to 512×512
  └── Extract thumbnail PNGs

  ├── ExerciseVideoCache — preloads all 12 videos on HomeScreen

  └── ExerciseThumbCard — recommendation list preview
```

**12 rendered exercises:** walk · march · squat · balance · tandem · calf · lunge · posture · shift · metro · fast · chest

## Database Schema

```sql
-- User profiles
profiles (id, full_name, age, stroke_date, affected_side, walking_aid, reminder_time)

-- Gait recording sessions
sessions (id, user_id, recorded_at, duration_seconds, video_url, status)

-- Computed gait metrics per session
gait_metrics (
  id, session_id, symmetry_index, cadence_spm, stride_length_m,
  joint_deviation_deg, trunk_lean_deg, stride_consistency,
  fall_risk_level, recovery_score, deficit_flags[]
)

-- AI-generated clinical reports
reports (id, user_id, session_id, generated_at, content_json, pdf_url)
```

Row-Level Security (RLS) enforces `auth.uid() = user_id` on all tables. No cross-patient data access is possible.

## Design System

StepSure uses a **medical teal** palette designed for clinical clarity and accessibility.

```dart
// Primary palette
static const Color teal       = Color(0xFF3AABAB);  // Primary actions
static const Color tealDark   = Color(0xFF1F7A7A);  // Headers, emphasis
static const Color tealLight  = Color(0xFF7DD4D4);  // Secondary text
static const Color tealPale   = Color(0xFFE0F5F5);  // Backgrounds, cards

// Backgrounds
static const Color bgGradientStart = Color(0xFFDFF2F7);
static const Color bgGradientEnd   = Color(0xFFC2E5EF);

// Semantic
static const Color warning    = Color(0xFFF5A623);  // Fall risk moderate
static const Color danger     = Color(0xFFE05454);  // Fall risk high
static const Color success    = Color(0xFF4AE08A);  // Recovery milestones

// Typography: Nunito (rounded, approachable, clinical-friendly)
```

---

## Clinical Disclaimer

StepSure is a **wellness and monitoring tool**, not a medical device making clinical diagnoses. The app is designed to support, not replace, professional physiotherapy care.

- All exercise prescriptions are conservative by default
- High fall risk triggers a consultation recommendation, not more exercises
- Analysis results should be shared with and interpreted by a qualified physiotherapist
- Clinical validation (Phase 1 concurrent validity study) is in progress
